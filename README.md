## Using a reddit URL download the content into a text file

In the terminal, input the code:

```
python getURL.py your_URL
```
In this case the Reddit URL I chose was:
https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/16ik507/mario_kart_8_deluxe_booster_course_pass_wave_6/

So the input would be 
```
python getURL.py https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/16ik507/mario_kart_8_deluxe_booster_course_pass_wave_6/
```
This should output all the text data from the URL to the URL.txt file
