# Project-1
## Using a reddit URL download the content into a text file

In the terminal, input the code:
```
python getURL.py your_URL
```
So the input would be: 
```
 python getURL.py "https://old.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/16ik507/mario_kart_8_deluxe_booster_course_pass_wave_6/"
```
This should output all the text data from the URL to the URL.txt file 

# Project-2 
## Using the URL text file you made in Project-1 extract the comments into a comment text file
In the terminal, input the code:
```
python extractComments.py URL.txt
```
This should extract all the comments and place them in the comment.txt file
